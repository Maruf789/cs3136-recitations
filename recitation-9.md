## Trees ##

### What's a tree? ###
A tree is a data structure with a set of linked nodes in a hierarchical tree-like structure.

### What are the parts of a tree? ###
The root of the tree is the top most node on the tree (Think of it like an upside down real tree).
Two nodes can be related to each other as "parent" and "child" nodes.  The parent node "points" to the child node.
In a graphical represenatation of a tree, the parent is on top of the child.
The leaves of the tree are the nodes that don't have any children. (If the tree consists of one node, that node is both a root anda leaf!)
