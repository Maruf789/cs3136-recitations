## 'Git' er Done ##

### Make a Data Structures Directory ###

If you haven't already, please make a 3136 directory on your clic account with the following command in your home directory:
    mkdir 3136
Change into the directory with the command:
    cd 3136

### Configuring git ###

So in order to use git, you must first let it know who you are.  Do this by telling git your name and email:
    git config --global user.name "Jae Woo Lee" 
    git config --global user.email jae@cs.columbia.edu

### Repositories/ ###

A git repository is a place to store fun stuff like code, projects, and in our case recitation notes, homework skeleton code, or homework solutions for you!  Github.com is a website where users make repositories to share and update code with one another.

Once Jae has added the skeleton code for your assignment, you will be able to clone
